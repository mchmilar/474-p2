	\subsection*{Which best fit this problem: an expert system, a knowledge base system or (Multi) agent system and why?}
		An expert system would provide sufficient means to address the problem, but would not be properly integrated into the Amazon environment. In this case, a knowledge based system could be used if we wanted adaptive learning responses from network selections. For instance, if you repeatedly followed links from certain individuals in your network, a knowledge base system (KB) could adapt from this information and provide you more feedback from the peers with which you share more purchasing interests. Although this would make sense, it is assumed that network information is already pre-determined and, thus, such learning procedure would be overkill.
		
		Instead, a simple embedded agent that could interact autonomously with the Amazon environment. This would be a reactive agent, without learning capabilities because, as discussed previously, the complexity of having a learning and adaptive agent would be too expensive to justify its implementation in this case.
